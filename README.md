Placeholder Readme while autosplitter is being worked on.



Steps for setting up the auto splitter.

1. Go to https://github.com/Avasam/AutoSplit#tutorial and download the latest auto splitter release, and scroll down to Live Split Integration to get the .dll. Version at time of writing: v2.0.0
2. Place the downloaded Autosplitter.exe and the Folders containg the splits in the same folder
3. In OBS in the sources column right click your video capture and click "Windowed Projector (sources)"
4. Make sure autosplitter sees the window, if the left side stays blank try clicking "Select Window" then your projector.
5. Set the path of the Exe and the settings file.
6. If the game is visible in the left window you should be good to start, if you start and the picture on the right dosen't show up then something during setup went wrong.

* Due to Speedrun.com time ruling and the way the auto splitter works, I cannot make the autosplitter start at the appropriate time. You will have to start your timer like normal then the autosplitter will take over until the very last split.
* The autosplitter does not prevent you from manually splitting, so if it misses a split you can manually do it and the autosplitter will adjust accordingly.
