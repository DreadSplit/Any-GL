Steps for setting up the auto splitter.

1. Go to https://github.com/Avasam/AutoSplit#tutorial and download the latest auto splitter release, and scroll down to Live Split Integration to get the .dll. Version at time of writing: v2.0.0
2. Place the downloaded Autosplitter.exe and the contents of this zip in the same folder
3. In OBS in the sources column right click your video capture and click "Windowed Projector (sources)"
4. Make sure autosplitter sees the window, if the left side stays blank try clicking "Select Window" then your projector.
5. Set the path of the Exe and the settings file.
	5-1. In Livesplit's Auto Splitter settings make sure you check "Pause Game Time Only". If you do not and you are using the load remover I can not garuntee your run will be legal to submit. I can almost garuntee it won't be.
6. If the game is visible in the left window you should be good to start, if you start and the picture on the right dosen't show up then something during setup went wrong.

* Due to Speedrun.com time ruling and the way the auto splitter works, I cannot make the autosplitter start at the appropriate time. You will have to start your timer like normal then the autosplitter will take over.
* The autosplitter does not prevent you from manually splitting, so if it misses a split you can manually do it and the autosplitter will adjust accordingly.
* The files are all labeled either +LR(with load remover) or -LR(without load remover)
